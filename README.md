# Buckshot Python
A reproduction of the underlying logic of 2023 game [Buckshot Roulette](https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/buckshot-roulette), by [Mike Klubnika](https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/) in python. For projects that require running the game multiple times in parallel, or measuring the outcome of a large sample-size of games, this might be useful. It's meant to run quickly, consume fewer resources, and hopefully integrate with other scripts.

In the future, I want to make this modular, make it easier to add items, make tweaks, and edit the dealer's behaviour. It would be interesting to see how different factors alter the game's probabilities.

Meant to aid the development of further Buckshot research. Probably sucks, but will be improved upon.

Please support the game's developer. He rocks, and the game is two dollars.   
If you are Mike Klubnika and you don't like this, please [contact me](mailto:thelampl1ght3r@gmail.com) and I will take this down.
